# Talking-Gloves
we represent smart glove for deaf and dumb patient. The blind people can talk freely by means of normal language whereas the deaf-dumb have their own manual-visual language known as sign language. The languages do not have a common origin and hence difficult to interpret. The project aims to facilitate people by means of a glove based communication interpreter system.

The glove is internally equipped with five flex sensors. For each specific gesture, the flex sensor produces a proportional change in resistance. The processing of these hand gestures is in Arduino UNO Board which is an advance version of the microcontroller. It compares the input signal with predefined voltage levels stored in memory. According to that required sound is produced which is stored is memory with the help of speaker. In such a way it is easy for deaf and dumb to communicate with normal people.
